                Intelligent Email Processing and Response Automation   
 
Goal:
Start to design and develop a Machine Learning model that automatically analyzes incoming emails, classifies them into predefined categories, determines priority levels, and generates appropriate responses or escalates them to human operators.

Objective:
1.	To automatically retrieve emails from a configured mailbox.
2.	Use ML-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand email content
3.	To classify emails such as inquiry, complaint, request, or spam.
4.	To assign priority levels based on urgency.
5.	Generate intelligent responses or forward emails when automation is not confident
6.	To maintain logs of all processed emails for administrative monitoring.

Functional Requirements:
1.  Automatically fetch incoming emails from a configured email server.
2.  Analyse the subject and body of each email.
3.  Classify emails using predefined keyword-based rules.
4.  Generate automated responses for known categories.
5.  Store logs of received emails and actions taken.
6.  Allow administrators to add or modify classification rules.

Non-Functional Requirements:
1.	Process an email as fast as possible.
2.	Ensure confidentiality of email data.
