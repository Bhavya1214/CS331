                Intelligent Email Processing and Response Automation   
 
Goal:<br>
Start to design and develop a rule-based intelligent email processing system, then, if possible, develop an ML /Deep Learning based processing system that automatically reads incoming emails, classifies them using predefined rules and keywords, assigns priority levels, and sends appropriate automated responses.<br>

Objective:
1.	To automatically retrieve emails from a configured mailbox.
2.	To analyse email subject and body using predefined rules.
3.	To classify emails such as inquiry, complaint, request, or spam.
4.	To assign priority levels based on keywords and sender type.
5.	To generate predefined automated replies.
6.	To maintain logs of all processed emails.<br>

Functional Requirements:<br>


Non-Functional Requirements:<br>
1. Process and respond to emails within a short time.
2. Handle a large number of emails without performance degradation.
3. Provide accurate email classification and intent detection.
4. Work continuously without failure and ensure email delivery.
5. Securely access email accounts and protect user data.
6. Provide a simple and user-friendly admin interface.
7. Should be easy to update and maintain.
