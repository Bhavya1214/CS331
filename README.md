                Intelligent Email Processing and Response Automation   
 
Goal:
Start to design and develop a rule-based intelligent email processing system, then, if possible, develop an ML /Deep Learning based processing system that automatically reads incoming emails, classifies them using predefined rules and keywords, assigns priority levels, and sends appropriate automated responses.

2.	To analyse email subject and body using predefined rules.
3.	To classify emails such as inquiry, complaint, request, or spam.
4.	To assign priority levels based on keywords and sender type.
5.	To generate predefined automated replies.
6.	To maintain logs of all processed emails..

Functional Requirements:
1.  Automatically fetch incoming emails from a configured email server.
2.  Analyse the subject and body of each email.
3.  Classify emails using predefined keyword-based rules.
4.  Generate automated responses for known categories.
5.  Store logs of received emails and actions taken.
6.  Allow administrators to add or modify classification rules.
