Intelligent Email Processing & Response Automation System
UML Use Case Diagram – Explanation


System Boundary

The large rectangle in the UML diagram represents the System Boundary, labeled as:

“Intelligent Email Processing & Response Automation System”

All functionalities inside the boundary are performed by the system.

All entities outside the boundary are external actors interacting with the system.

Actors (External Entities)
1. User (Mail Sender)

The User represents the person who sends emails to the system.

Responsibilities:

Sends emails to the system

Reviews auto-generated email drafts

Sends replies manually if automation fails or requires confirmation

2. Email Server (IMAP/SMTP)

The Email Server is an external service responsible for email communication.

Responsibilities:

Provides incoming emails using IMAP

Sends outgoing emails using SMTP

Assists in managing responses and drafts

Main Use Cases
Receive Emails

The system receives emails from the Email Server

This is the starting point of the entire workflow

Analyze Emails

The system examines incoming emails

Triggered immediately after emails are received

Helps identify intent, priority, and overall purpose of the email

Analyze Email Content (<<include>>)

A mandatory sub-process

Used by:

Analyze Emails

Classify Emails

Extracts keywords, intent, urgency, and context

Note:
<<include>> indicates that this functionality always occurs as part of the parent use case.

Classify Emails

Categorizes emails into types such as:

Complaint

Query

Request

Spam

Depends on analyzed email content

Determines the type of response required

Generate Automated Response

Automatically creates a reply based on email classification

Uses predefined templates or AI-based logic

Send Automated Reply

Sends the generated response automatically to the sender

Represents the ideal and successful execution path

Review and Fallback Scenarios (<<extend>>)
Review Auto-Draft

Activated when:

Automation confidence is low

The system is unsure of the response

Allows the user to review and edit the draft before sending

Send Draft (<<extend>>)

Executed only if automation fails

User manually sends the reviewed draft

Note:
<<extend>> indicates an optional or conditional flow that occurs only under specific circumstances.

Administrative and Management Use Cases
Manage Responses

Manages:

Sent automated replies

Failed automation cases

Draft handling and tracking

Update Classification Rules

Improves accuracy of email classification

Learns from previous responses and user corrections

Configure Email Server

Configures IMAP and SMTP settings

Required for seamless email communication

Relationship Summary
<<include>>

Represents mandatory functionality

Example:

Analyze Emails → Analyze Email Content

<<extend>>

Represents optional or conditional behavior

Example:

Send Draft → Executed if automation fails

Overall Workflow (Simplified)

Email is received from the Email Server

Email content is analyzed

Email is classified

Automated response is generated

System sends reply automatically

If automation fails, the user reviews and sends a draft

System improves classification rules over time
